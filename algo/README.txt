Algorithms:

Baseline : Simple implementation of Mays model tested against the T20 Brown Corpus with alpha=0.9.
DA : Dynamic alpha model implementation tested against the T20 Brown Corpus with alpha=0.9 and beta in [0.05,0.1,0.2].
UPMM : Unequal Probability Mass Dsitribution model tested against the T20 Brown Corpus with alpha=0.9.
Combined : Combined model tested against the T20 Brown Corpus with alpha=0.9.

Results including precision,Recall and F-score are generated in individual text files in this folder after the code has run successfully.

Note:- Models will only run when the test-set is generated in the corpus_handler folder.To generate test-set read the README text file there.
